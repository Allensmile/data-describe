data_describe.backends
=============================

.. py:module:: data_describe.backends

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   data-describe backends.

   This subpackage implements a pluggable architecture for the data-describe package. This allows third-party libraries to provide alternative implementation details for data-describe, such as implementing Bokeh visualizations for data-describe features. Default implementations in data-describe are also exposed as plugins to this backend system.
